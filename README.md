### Enshrouded Server Management Script

A lightweight Bash script to manage Enshrouded servers using Wine, created as an alternative to Docker. Includes functionality for downloading/updating, starting, stopping, and restarting the server. Works via both an interactive menu and command-line arguments.

#### Notes:
- The server files will be installed in the directory where you run the script.
- The server configuration file is located at `enshrouded-server/enshrouded_server.json`.
- The Wine prefix is located at `~/.wine/enshrouded_server`.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zerschranzer/ensmanager.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the directory:
   ```bash
